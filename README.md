## spacefeeder
Spacenavigator input converter to WASD keys and Right Click Mouse move to navigate Sansar.

#### Running the binary
Open the Spacefeeder.exe, leave it running in the background.
The app takes the inputs from your Spacenavigator and uses those inputs to
simulate key presses (WASD) and a right click mouse movement (horizontal axis only)

#### Update Spacefeeder_6
All inputs have now an on/off and invert switch

#### Editing the Maxpatch
The max patch is included in the "code" folder.

#### Dependencies 
(you only need to install them if you want to edit the code)
